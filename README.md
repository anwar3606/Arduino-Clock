# Arduino-Clock
A Simple Arduino Clock with OLED 1306 Driver showing Date and Time

#Sync
In order to sync the time with your pc, You have to get the [DateSync](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/other_file.md) Application that I made. It just takes the time from the pc and send it to the Arduino Uno Serial Port.
